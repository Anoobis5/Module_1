# Module_1 - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project was designed to analyze trends in creating a Kickstarter Campaign for a Play. The visualized data analyzes how different trends and factors can influence the success of a Kickstarter campaign. 
### Purpose
The purose of the original analysis was to provide Louise a guide on how to best create a Kickstarter for her play _Fever_, that is estimated to cost $12,000. However, Louise fell short of making her goal. The data analyzed in this report will provide information that depicts factors that can affect a Kickstarter campaign's success, and and how Louise's Kickstarter fared in comparison.

## Data Analysis and Challenges
Louise wanted to compare how her Play Kickstarter for _Fever_ compared to similar Kickstarters. 

Upon initial analysis of the Kickstarters data collected, we observed that campaigns for Theater Kickstarters showed good odds of success overall, as well as Kickstarters in the sub-category for Plays, as shown in the two graphs below:

In order to aim for the best chances of Louise's Kickstarer campaign seeing success, we analyzed when would  be the most opportune time for her to launch her campaign. We analyzed the outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns in correlation to their Launch Dates, as depicted by the graph below:

Looking at our data, we can observe that May appears to have the highest success rate for launch outcomes.
The months of May, June, and July all have the high success rates for Theater Kickstarter campaigns;and December would bv the worst month to launch with almost as many campaigns failing. 
We also analyzed the Outcomes Based on Goals to observe is there a correlation to their success.

Louise was also looking to create a Kickstarter for a play in Great Britain, with a budget of. The chart below displays compares the discriptive statistics of the Goals and Pledges of Musical Kickstarters in Great Britain:

Looking at this chart, we can observe that the average Goal for successful Musical Kickstarters in Great Britain is about €4,000. 

In both data set we observed that the higher the goal the higher the rate of failure. Louise's play _Fever_ is twise as much as the average across Kickstarters in both the United States and in Great Britain. Theater Kickstarters in the United States with a similar goal have around a 46% succes rate. Our data would also suggest that Louise should aim to have her musical produced for less than €4,000, becasue about half of the campaign goals are a little over the 3rd quartile for ammounts pledged at €2,000.

Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the biggest challenges in the data we were able to present was the lack of data that could provide a more specific direction Louise to take when creating her Kickstarter campaign. We were able to identify some factors that could result in a successful Kickstarter, but many factors limited how succeessful she could be based on the data provided. One factor we did not consider, was whether the length a campaign was active had an effect on the campaign's success. We could have added a chart defining campaign length and what constitutes a 'short' time vs a 'long' campaign. However, since Louise's campaign came close to reaching it's goal in a short period of time, there may have been another factor that hindered her success other than the length of the campaign.  The data that we have, we can only observe Kickstarters from 2014 - 2016. This creates a limitation in the rang of our data. In order to have a better understanding of successful Kickstarters for her campaign, we would need to collect more recent data. Collecting  information on average donation along with the average pledge amaounts at certain times of the year could give us information on whether the time a campaign was created, along with the campaign length, could affect how much a backer could donate. Donations could be affected by outside limiting factors such as Tax season vs Christmas time resulting in people being more generous with donations. Average Donations with campaign length could also give useful informastion that could lead to campaign success

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#### Looking at our data on the Outcomes Based on Lauunch Dates, we were able to conclude that:
#hr
1. May-late June are the most opportune Launch Dates for a Kickstarter campaign related to Theater and/or Plays

2. The Higher the Goal Amount, the higher the chance the Kickstarter will result in failure,
 Knowning the opportune launch date may be paramount to Louise's success with her high goal.
#hr

#### Looked at the Outcomes Based on Goals, we can conclude that:
1. Kickstarter campaigns with higher Goals have a higher chance to fail compared to successful campaigns with lower goals.

2. Knowing this, it could be a problem for Louise's campaign., because looking at our data her goal is well above the average goal for successful campaigns. This could result in failure for her campaign in Great Britain.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
#### Some limitations of our datasets are:

-We would need to know how long she would be willing to have her campaign Live to reach her goal
How many backers were active at the time this data was collected. Are those Kickstarters donaters still donating to Theater related Kickstarters in the US and/or Great Britain.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Other tables and graphs we could create are: bar graph of theater, musical, play kickstarters with success/live/fail/canceled results
 Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

She should reduce her goal is possible

We could also add a box plot about successfully funded plays in the US to get a better idea of values for Kickstarters in the US demo before pursuing them.
