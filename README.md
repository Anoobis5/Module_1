# Module_1 - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project was design to guide one's interest in creating a Kickstarter Campaign for a Play. The visualized data analyzes how different trends and factors can influence the success of a Kickstarter campaign. 
### Purpose
Our purose was to provide Louise a guide on best approach for a realistix goal and Launch Data timeline for a Kickstarter campaign for her play _Fever_. The data analyzed will provide vital information that depicts factors that can affect a Kickstarter campaign's success.

## Analysis and Challenges
Louise wanted to compare how her Play Kickstarter for _Fever_ compared to similar Kickstarters
(Line graph of Theatert outcomes based on Launch Date)
May and June are the best months to launch her Kickstarter
December is the worst month to launch a Theater/Play kickstarter
We also analyzed the Outcomes Based on Goals to observe is there a correlation to their success. 
(insert Outcomes Based on Goal graph)
Louise was also looking to create a Kickstarter for a play in Great Britain. 
(insert Box Plot)
Our data here shoes that both the mean and median pledge amounts are significantly lower than the successful pldges. This indicates that failed Kickstarters are unsuccessful for reasons other than a large Goal
Our data also suggests that Louise should try to have her musical produced for less than 4k Euro, becasue about half of the campaign goals are less than 2K Euros.

Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

She should reduce her goal is possible

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While she started in May June the length of her campaign and the goal could have results in the campaigns failure. Given that she came close to her goal in a short period of time, there may have been another factor that hindered her success. Maybe add a chart defining campaign length and success, and what constitutes a 'short' campaign. Less than 4 weeks? Outcomes Based on Length bar graph? With the data we have, we can observed Kickstarters that were Live during the time of collection, but this limits whether or not length could be a factor for success or failure. Information on average donation along with the average pledge amaounts could give us information on whether the timing could affect how much a backer could donate.  Donations could be affected by outside limiting facotrs such ass Tax season vs Christmas time resulting in people being more generous with donations. Average Donations with campaign length could also give useful informastion that could lead to campaign success

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-  (May-June are the most opportune Launch Dates for a Kickstarter campaigns related to Theatre/Plays)
-  The Higher the Goal Amount, the higher the cha nce a Kickstarter will fail.
-  Knowning the opportune launch date may be paramount to Louise's success with her high goal.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Kickstarter campaigns with higher Goals have a tendency to fail in comparison to Successful campaigns
- This can be a problem for Louise, because looking at our data (insert chart) her goal is more than 2x the average goal. This could result in failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-one of the limitations of the data is the date range. The data gathered consists of Kickstarters from 2014 - 2016. TO have a better understanding of successful Kickstarters for her campaign, we would need to collect more recent data.
-We would need to know how long she would be willing to have her campaign Live to reach her goal
How many backers were active at the time this data was collected. Are those Kickstarters donaters still donating to Theater related Kickstarters in the US and/or Great Britain.
-
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Other tables and graphs we could create are: bar graph of theater, musical, play kickstarters with success/live/fail/canceled results
-
 Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

She should reduce her goal is possible
