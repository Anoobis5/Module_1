## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-  (May-June are the most opportune Launch Dates for a Kickstarter campaigns related to Theatre/Plays)
-  The Higher the Goal Amount, the higher the chance a Kickstarter will fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Kickstarter campaigns with higher Goals have a tendency to fail in comparison to Successful campaigns
- This can be a problem for Louise, because looking at our data (insert chart) her goal is more than 2x the average goal. This could result in failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
