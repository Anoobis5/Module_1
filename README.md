# Module_1 - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project was designed to analyze trends in creating a Kickstarter Campaign for a Play. The visualized data analyzes how different trends and factors can influence the success of a Kickstarter campaign. 
### Purpose
The purose of the original analysis was to provide Louise a guide on how to best create a Kickstarter for her play _Fever_, that is estimated to cost $12,000. However, Louise fell short of making her goal. The data analyzed in this report will provide information that depicts factors that can affect a Kickstarter campaign's success, and and how Louise's Kickstarter fared in comparison.

## Data Analysis and Challenges
Louise wanted to compare how her Play Kickstarter for _Fever_ compared to similar Kickstarters. 

Upon initial analysis of the Kickstarters data collected, we observed that campaigns for Theater Kickstarters showed good odds of success overall, as well as Kickstarters in the sub-category for Plays, as shown in the two graphs below:

![Sub_Category_Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84881187/121794602-a3b6b780-cbd7-11eb-8e4a-e0ca2f354c6d.png)

In order to aim for the best chances of Louise's Kickstarer campaign seeing success, we analyzed when would  be the most opportune time for her to launch her campaign. We analyzed the outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns in correlation to their Launch Dates, as depicted by the graph below:

Looking at our data, we can observe that May appears to have the highest success rate for launch outcomes.
The months of May, June, and July all have the high success rates for Theater Kickstarter campaigns;and December would bv the worst month to launch with almost as many campaigns failing. 
We also analyzed the Outcomes Based on Goals to observe is there a correlation to their success.

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84881187/121792910-7282bb00-cbc8-11eb-9c3e-527593a34696.png)
(insert Outcomes Based on Goal graph)
 In general, we observed that the higher the goal the higheer the rate of failure. Louise's play _Fever_ istwise as much as the average. (CONFIRM THIS)

Louise was also looking to create a Kickstarter for a play in Great Britain. 
(insert Box Plot)
Our data here shoes that both the mean and median pledge amounts are significantly lower than the successful pldges. This indicates that failed Kickstarters are unsuccessful for reasons other than a large Goal
Our data also suggests that Louise should try to have her musical produced for less than 4k Euro, becasue about half of the campaign goals are less than 2K Euros.

Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

She should reduce her goal is possible

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In general, the higher the goal, the higher the rate of failure. Louise's play _Fever_ if twise as much as the average. (CONFIRM THIS)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge was the lack of more specific actions for Louise to take. We were able to create a guide to success, but many factors limited how succeessful she could be based on the data provided.

While she started in May June the length of her campaign and the goal could have results in the campaigns failure. Given that she came close to her goal in a short period of time, there may have been another factor that hindered her success. Maybe add a chart defining campaign length and success, and what constitutes a 'short' campaign. Less than 4 weeks? Outcomes Based on Length bar graph? With the data we have, we can observed Kickstarters that were Live during the time of collection, but this limits whether or not length could be a factor for success or failure. Information on average donation along with the average pledge amaounts could give us information on whether the timing could affect how much a backer could donate.  Donations could be affected by outside limiting facotrs such ass Tax season vs Christmas time resulting in people being more generous with donations. Average Donations with campaign length could also give useful informastion that could lead to campaign success

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-  (May-June are the most opportune Launch Dates for a Kickstarter campaigns related to Theatre/Plays)
-  The Higher the Goal Amount, the higher the cha nce a Kickstarter will fail.
-  Knowning the opportune launch date may be paramount to Louise's success with her high goal.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Kickstarter campaigns with higher Goals have a tendency to fail in comparison to Successful campaigns
- This can be a problem for Louise, because looking at our data (insert chart) her goal is more than 2x the average goal. This could result in failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-one of the limitations of the data is the date range. The data gathered consists of Kickstarters from 2014 - 2016. TO have a better understanding of successful Kickstarters for her campaign, we would need to collect more recent data.
-We would need to know how long she would be willing to have her campaign Live to reach her goal
How many backers were active at the time this data was collected. Are those Kickstarters donaters still donating to Theater related Kickstarters in the US and/or Great Britain.
-
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Other tables and graphs we could create are: bar graph of theater, musical, play kickstarters with success/live/fail/canceled results
-
 Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the US. Play vs Kickstarter success (pursue play because...)

She should reduce her goal is possible

We could also add a box plot about successfully funded plays in the US to get a better idea of values for Kickstarters in the US demo before pursuing them.
